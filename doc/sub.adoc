== NAME
sub - subscribe to MQTT topics

== SYNOPSIS
*sub* [_OPTIONS_]

== DESCRIPTION
*sub* connects to the given MQTT broker and subscribes to all topics specified.
Messages received on a topic are printed to stdout, prefixed with the topic the
message was received on.

All options can be passed either as command-line arguments or can be specified
in a simple config file.

== OPTIONS
*-broker* _URL_::
    broker address (should be in the form of a _URL_)

*-ca-root* _FILE_::
    path to a _FILE_ containing CA certificates (optional)

*-cert-file* _FILE_::
    authenticate with a certificate

*-clean*::
    discard any pending messages from the broker (default true)

*-client-id* _STRING_::
    unique identifier for this client (defaults to a semi-random string)

*-config* _FILE_::
    path to _FILE_ containing configuration values (optional)

*-header* _KEY=VALUE_::
    set an HTTP header (in _KEY=VALUE_ form) (can be specified multiple times)

*-key-file* _FILE_::
    authenticate with a private key

*-password* _STRING_::
    authenticate with a password

*-qos* _INTEGER_::
    quality of service for messages

*-topic* _STRING_::
    topic to publish or subscribe to (can be specified multiple times)

*-username* _STRING_::
    authenticate with a username

*-verbose*::
    increase output

== CONFIGURATION
Any option may be specified as a value in a configuration file instead of (or in
addition to) a command-line option. Values present on the command-line take
precedent over values in the configration file. Thus it is easy to create a base
configration file that can be augmented easily at run time.

The configuration file takes the form of a simple space-separated "option value"
format (i.e. "broker tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883").

== EXAMPLES
Connect to a broker anonymously and subscribe to two topics.
----
sub -broker tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883 -topic mqttcli/pubtest -topic mqttcli/pubtest1
----

Connect to a broker using username/password authentication and subscribe to a
topic.
----
sub -broker tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1884 -username ro -password readonly -topic mqttcli/pubtest
----
